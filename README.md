# Code Snippets

###### Author: [Pieter Bos](https://github.com/senlin)

Collection of mostly WordPress Code Snippets.

## Description

This Repository is a collection of Code Snippets related to WordPress gathered from around the web. 

I started this as a local folder of snippets that I would use frequently, which has as obvious advantage that I didn't have to search through my bookmarks, or worse, click on a link that no longer exists.

When I had collected quite a few Code Snippets I decided that others might as well benefit from it too, so I gave them this Repository on Github.

I still add snippets to the Repository whenever I feel they can benefit me or others.

### Attribution

Where deemed necessary Code Snippets are attributed with the original source.

### so_ prefix

I have prefixed most snippets with "`so_`", which of course can be changed to something else.
