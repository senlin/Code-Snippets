# Code Snippets

###### Author: [Piet Bos](https://github.com/senlin)

Collection of mostly WordPress Code Snippets.

## Description

This Repository is a collection of WordPress Code Snippets gathered from around the web. 

I started this as a local folder of snippets that I would use frequently, which has as obvious advantage that I didn't have to search through my bookmarks, or worse, click on a link that no longer exists.

When I had collected quite a few Code Snippets I decided that others might as well benefit from it too, so I gave them this Repository on Github.

I still add snippets to the Repository whenever I feel they can benefit me or others.

### Attribution

Where deemed necessary Code Snippets are attributed with the original source.

### so_ prefix

I have prefixed most snippets with "```so_```", you can of course change that to whatever you like.

## Contributions

Feel free to fork this Repository and if you want to contribute to it, that would be much appreciated.
